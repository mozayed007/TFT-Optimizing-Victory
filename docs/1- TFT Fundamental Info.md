## 2) Set 10 (Season 10) Economy Plans

# Teamfight Tactics Set 10 Updates and Economy Plans

## Leveling Guide

**General Tips:**

- Save gold if you need to.
- Roll at a specific level and you have not reached that level yet.
- You are healthy.
- You have a strong board that is already upgraded.
- Roll if you need to preserve your Health.
- Complete a lot of pairs.
- Need units at a specific cost and you are at the optimal level to roll for them.
- Need a new Headliner.
- Level up if you need to add an extra unit to activate a key trait (you will need to level up no matter what the cost).
- Roll to obtain units at a specific cost (you will need to have enough gold to roll after spending gold on leveling up).
- Have too much extra gold and you might as well buy XP.

**Color Key:**

- G: Usually level at this stage.

- Y: Situationally level at this stage.

- R: Rarely level at this stage.

  ---

  

### I) Standard

**Level 4 – Stage 2-1, 2-2, 2-3**

- Do not Roll

**Level 5 – Stage 2-3, 2-5, 2-7, 3-1**

- Do not Roll

**Level 6 (Have 20-30g+ after leveling) – Stage 3-1, 3-2, 3-5**

- Generally do not Roll. Only Roll on 3-2 if you have a lot of pairs OR if you are low health and some pairs. Can be anywhere from 10-30g (roll more if you have lower health). Sell your 1 cost Headliner to find a 2 or 3 cost Headliner if you do roll.

**Level 7 (Have 30g+ after leveling) – Stage 3-5, 4-1, 4-2**

- Typically roll a little bit after reaching level 7 because you need to stabilize your board if you have pairs or if you are low hp. If you are healthy, maybe 10 gold. If not, roll until stable (20-40g+). If you already have upgrades and have good health, Fast 8 instead.

**Level 8 (Have 30g+ after leveling) – Stage 4-2, 4-5, 5-1, 5-2**

- Usually roll a lot of gold (30-50g+) on level 8 unless your board is already 2* or if you are 80hp+. Sell your 3 or lower cost Headliner to find a 4 cost Headliner in most cases.

**Level 9 – Stage 5-1, 5-2, 5-5, 6-1, 6-2, 6-5**

- Roll most of your gold when you hit level 9 unless you are doing something very specific.

**Level 10 – Stage 6+**

- Go to Level 10 if you have all upgrades already and can’t realistically get any good 3* units OR if you need to activate a crucial trait breakpoint.

  ---

  

### II) Fast 8 (similar to Standard)

**Level 4 – Stage 2-1, 2-2, 2-3**

- Do not Roll

**Level 5 – Stage 2-3, 2-5, 2-7, 3-1**

- Do not Roll

**Level 6 (Have 30g+ after leveling) – Stage 3-1, 3-2, 3-5**

- Do not Roll

**Level 7 (Have 30g+ after leveling) – Stage 3-5, 4-1, 4-2**

- Do not Roll

**Level 8 (Have 30g+ after leveling) – Stage 4-2, 4-5, 5-1**

- Sell your Headliner and Roll all your gold

**Level 9 – Stage 5-1, 5-2, 5-5, 6-1, 6-2, 6-5**

- Roll most of your gold when you hit level 9 unless you are doing something very specific.

**Level 10 – Stage 6+**

- Go to Level 10 if you have all upgrades already and can’t realistically get any good 3* units OR if you need to activate a crucial trait breakpoint.

### III) 1-Cost Reroll Leveling

**Level 4 – Stage 2-3**

- At Stage 3-1 while you are still level 4, roll down to 30g. If you have 7+ copies of the unit you want after rolling to 30g, roll another 10. If you have 8 copies after that, then roll another 10 again. You can also consider Hyper Rolling (rolling all your gold) if you are low health and desperate.

**Level 5 (50+ gold) – Stage 3-2**

- Slow Roll at level 5. Slow Rolling is rolling down to 50g every turn while buying all the units you want. Think about ‘all inning’ (rolling all your gold) or ‘fishing’ (rolling gold 10g at a time to see if you get an additional copy of your unit) when you have 6+ copies of the most important unit to save HP. At Stage 4-1, roll until you hit your unit(s).

**Level 6 – Stage 3-x, 4-x**

- Typically after you get your crucial 3*s, you spend all your money on leveling for most of the game to add in additional traits.

**Level 7 – Stage 4-x, 5-x**

**Level 8 – Stage 5-x, 6-x**

**Level 9 – Stage 6-x**

**Level 10 – Stage 7-x**

---



### IV) 2-Cost Reroll Leveling

**Level 4 – Stage 2-1, 2-3**

- Do not Roll

**Level 5 – Stage 2-5, 3-1, 3-2**

- Do not Roll

**Level 6 (50+ gold) – Stage 3-2, 3-5**

- Slow Roll at level 6. Slow Rolling is rolling down to 50g every turn while buying all the units you want. Think about ‘all inning’ (rolling all your gold) or ‘fishing’ (rolling gold 10g at a time to see if you get an additional copy of your unit) when you have 6+ copies of the most important unit to save HP.

**Level 7 – Stage 4-x, 5-x**

- Typically after you get your crucial 3*s, you spend all your money on leveling for most of the game to add in additional traits.

**Level 8 – Stage 5-x, 6-x**

**Level 9 – Stage 6-x**

**Level 10 – Stage 7-x**

---



### V) 3-Cost Reroll Leveling

**Level 4 – Stage 2-1, 2-2, 2-3**

- Do not Roll

**Level 5 – Stage 2-3, 2-5, 2-7, 3-1**

- Do not Roll

**Level 6 – Stage 3-1, 3-2, 3-5**

- Sometimes you roll at Stage 3-2 to stabilize your board to hit 2* 3 cost units. Sometimes you look for a 3 cost Headliner here too. Do not be afraid to roll to 0 sometimes in desperate situations.

**Level 7 (50+ gold) – Stage 3-5, 4-1, 4-2**

- Stabilize by rolling until you get several 2*s of crucial units. After that, econ to 50g+ and then Slow Roll at this level. If you are not getting a lot of copies (4 or less) of your desired units, go Level 8 instead.

**Level 8 – Stage 5-x, 6-x**

**Level 9 – Stage 6-x**

**Level 10 – Stage 7-x**
